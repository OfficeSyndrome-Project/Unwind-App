A research project at the undergraduate level, focusing on the development of an application for the prevention and relief of office syndrome symptoms,
aims to create an application for individuals experiencing office syndrome. This app helps manage the symptoms by addressing pain points and providing self-assessment of office syndrome. 
It also enables users to track their self-treatment progress and adjust their working environment to prevent recurring symptoms, all according to the app's recommendations.
